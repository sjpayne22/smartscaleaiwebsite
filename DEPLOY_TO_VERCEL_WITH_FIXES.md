# Deploying SmartScale AI Website to Vercel with CSS Fixes

This guide covers the deployment process to Vercel with special focus on fixing CSS formatting issues.

## Prerequisites

- Vercel CLI installed (`npm install -g vercel`)
- Vercel account with access to the project
- Node.js and npm installed

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Use the Improved Build Process

Our team has created an enhanced build process specifically to address CSS formatting issues on Vercel. Use the following command to build the project:

```bash
node vercel-build-new.js
```

This enhanced build script:
- Ensures proper content type headers are set for CSS files
- Fixes asset paths to use absolute URLs for Vercel
- Adds proper MIME type headers via _headers file
- Handles both image and font asset paths correctly

### 2. Verify CSS Loading in Local Preview

Before deploying to Vercel, verify that CSS is working correctly in the local build:

```bash
npx serve build
```

Check the browser console for any 404 errors or MIME type warnings.

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

Use our simplified deployment script that incorporates all the fixes:

```bash
node deploy-vercel.js
```

This script will guide you through the deployment process and use our enhanced build configurations.

### 4. Verify Deployment

After deployment, check that CSS is loading correctly by:

1. Inspecting the network tab in browser dev tools
2. Verifying that CSS files have the correct MIME type (`text/css`)
3. Checking the console for any asset loading errors

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### CSS Not Loading

**Problem:** CSS files load but aren't applied correctly.

**Solution:** 
- Check that the `Content-Type` header is set to `text/css`
- Verify the CSS is not being blocked by CORS policies
- Ensure base tag is set to `<base href="/">`

### Asset Path Issues

**Problem:** 404 errors for asset files.

**Solution:**
- Make sure all asset references use absolute paths starting with `/assets/`
- Run the `fix-vercel-paths.js` script to automatically correct asset paths

### Content Type Issues

**Problem:** Browser warning about incorrect MIME types.

**Solution:**
- Verify the Vercel configuration has the correct content type headers
- Check that `_headers` file is being included in the deployment

## Advanced Configuration

If you continue to experience issues, you can customize the headers in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)\.css",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "text/css"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
