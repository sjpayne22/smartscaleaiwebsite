# WordPress API Integration Checklist

## Fixed WordPress Style Conflicts

This document provides a checklist for maintaining the isolation of WordPress content and preventing style conflicts:

### âœ… WordPress Isolation Solution

- [x] CSS isolation for WordPress content
- [x] IsolatedWordPressContent component for containing WordPress HTML
- [x] Isolated WordPress API service with fallback mechanism
- [x] Simplified Vercel deployment configuration

### ðŸ’» How the Solution Works

1. **Isolation Container**: WordPress content is rendered in isolated containers with CSS containment
2. **Style Reset**: Styles within containers are reset to prevent conflicts with main site styling
3. **Failsafe API**: Requests to WordPress API include timeouts and fallbacks
4. **Script Integration**: WordPress integration script is added to the page for runtime isolation

### ðŸ”„ Testing the Solution

After deploying, verify these pages work correctly:

- Blog page (shows posts from WordPress)
- Services page (if using WordPress for service content)
- Any other page that displays WordPress content

### ðŸš¨ If Problems Persist

If you still see formatting issues after deployment:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify WordPress API is accessible from your deployed site
3. Check if CSS files are being loaded correctly
4. Ensure wordpress-integration-fix.js is loaded properly

### ðŸ”§ WordPress API Requirements

Make sure WordPress has these plugins active:

- Custom Post Types UI
- Advanced Custom Fields
- REST API Filter Fields
- JWT Authentication for WP REST API

And verify these settings:

- REST API is enabled
- CORS is properly configured in WordPress settings
- Custom post types are exposed to the REST API
